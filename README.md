# Phising_incident
I was a level-one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. Previously, I had received a phishing alert regarding a suspicious file that had been downloaded on an employee's computer. After conducting an investigation, I checked the hash of the email attachment and confirmed that the attachment had already been verified as malicious. With this information, I followed my organization's process to complete the investigation and resolve the alert.

The security policies and procedures within the organization provided clear guidelines on how to handle specific alerts, including phishing incidents. I referred to the playbook, which contained a flowchart and detailed instructions to guide me through the process.

Once my investigation was complete, I updated the alert ticket with all my findings related to the incident, documenting each step I took and the evidence supporting the malicious nature of the attachment. This ensured that the alert was properly resolved according to organizational policies.
